# Merg: Multi-Agent Deep Research Platform

## Overview
Merg is a Netflix-style media deep-research platform that enables users to discover and access various media types through autonomous AI agents. The system specializes in finding, verifying, and retrieving web-based content through a multi-agent architecture.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Multi-Agent System
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Manages workflow and coordinates between specialized agents
- **Research Agents**: Specialized in finding content across different sources
- **Verification Agents**: Validate content authenticity and quality
- **Download Agents**: Handle secure content retrieval and processing

### 2. Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (existing)
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript (existing)
- **Agents**: LangChain + Playwright for web navigation
- **Database**: Vector DB for content indexing
- **Storage**: Secure file storage system

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Agent System
1. **Agent Framework Setup**
   - Implement base agent class with common functionality
   - Create agent registry for dynamic agent management
   - Set up inter-agent communication

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - **Research Agent**: Web navigation and content discovery
   - **Verification Agent**: Content validation and quality assessment
   - **Download Agent**: Secure file retrieval and processing

3. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Task decomposition and assignment
   - Result aggregation and ranking
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Phase 2: Web Integration
1. **Playwright Integration**
   - Headless browser automation
   - DOM interaction and content extraction
   - Handling of pop-ups and authentication

2. **Content Processing**
   - Media type detection
   - Content extraction and normalization
   - Metadata enrichment

### Phase 3: User Experience
1. **Search Interface**
   - Netflix-style grid for content discovery
   - Advanced search filters
   - Search history and saved items

2. **Feedback System**
   - Thumbs up/down ratings
   - Quality reporting
   - Search result relevance feedback

## Data Flow
1. User submits query
2. Orchestrator decomposes query into sub-tasks
3. Research agents search for relevant content
4. Verification agents validate findings
5. Download agents retrieve and process content
6. Results are aggregated and ranked
7. User provides feedback for continuous improvement

## Security & Compliance
- Secure content handling
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- User data protection
- DMCA compliance measures

## Performance Optimization
- Agent concurrency management
- Caching strategy
- Result deduplication
- Progressive result loading

## Monitoring & Analytics
- Agent performance metrics
- Search success rates
- User engagement tracking
- System health monitoring

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional content types
- Advanced AI-powered recommendations
- Browser extension for direct web integration
- API access for enterprise customers

## Business Model
- **Free Tier**: 3 deep searches per day
- **Pro Subscription**: Unlimited searches, priority access
- **Enterprise**: Custom solutions and API access
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Token-based system for occasional users

## Development Roadmap
1. **Month 1-2**: Core agent system and basic web integration
2. **Month 3-4**: User interface and feedback system
3. **Month 5-6**: Performance optimization and scaling
4. **Month 7+**: Advanced features and expansion

## Success Metrics
- Search success rate
- User engagement (searches per user)
- Content quality ratings
- System performance (response time, uptime)
- User retention and growth
